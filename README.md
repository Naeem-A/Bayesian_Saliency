The code is for paper "Visual Saliency Detection Based on color Frequency Features under Bayesian framework" 
by Naeem Ayoub, Zhenguo Gao, Danjie Chen, Rachida Tobji and Nianmin Yao.
Published in "KSII Transactions on Internet and Information Systems" 2018.

******************************************************************************************************************
The code is tested on Windows 10 with MATLAB R2010b, R2015a and R2017a.
and on mac (OSX) R2015b
****************************************************************************************************************** 

Usage:
1. Cal_FBS_Saliency
>>put your own images into file '/imgs'
>>run 'Cal_FBS_Saliency.m'
>>>The code will calculate the saliency map for each image in the folder "imgs"
and shows the process time for each image.
>>The final saliency maps will be saved in "FBS_salmaps" folder
